<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Taylor</span> sat back in his
chair reading the morning
newspaper. The warm kitchen
and the smell of coffee
blended with the comfort of not
having to go to work. This was
his Rest Period, the first for a
long time, and he was glad of
it. He folded the second section
back, sighing with contentment.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Mary said, from
the stove.</p>
<p>"They pasted Moscow again
last night." Taylor nodded his
head in approval. "Gave it a
real pounding. One of those R-H
bombs. It's about time."</p>
<p>He nodded again, feeling the
full comfort of the kitchen, the
presence of his plump, attractive
wife, the breakfast dishes and coffee.
This was relaxation. And the
war news was good, good and
satisfying. He could feel a justifiable
glow at the news, a sense
of pride and personal accomplishment.
After all, he was an
integral part of the war program,
not just another factory worker
lugging a cart of scrap, but a
technician, one of those who designed
and planned the nerve-trunk
of the war.</p>
<p>"It says they have the new
subs almost perfected. Wait until
they get <i>those</i> going." He smacked
his lips with anticipation.
"When they start shelling from
underwater, the Soviets are sure
going to be surprised."</p>
<p>"They're doing a wonderful
job," Mary agreed vaguely. "Do
you know what we saw today?
Our team is getting a leady to
show to the school children. I
saw the leady, but only for a
moment. It's good for the children
to see what their contributions
are going for, don't you
think?"</p>
<p>She looked around at him.</p>
<p>"A leady," Taylor murmured.
He put the newspaper slowly
down. "Well, make sure it's decontaminated
properly. We don't
want to take any chances."</p>
<p>"Oh, they always bathe them
when they're brought down from
the surface," Mary said. "They
wouldn't think of letting them
down without the bath. Would
they?" She hesitated, thinking
back. "Don, you know, it makes
me remember—"</p>
<p>He nodded. "I know."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> knew what she was thinking.
Once in the very first
weeks of the war, before everyone
had been evacuated from the
surface, they had seen a hospital
train discharging the wounded,
people who had been showered
with sleet. He remembered the
way they had looked, the expression
on their faces, or as
much of their faces as was left.
It had not been a pleasant sight.</p>
<p>There had been a lot of that
at first, in the early days before
the transfer to undersurface was
complete. There had been a lot,
and it hadn't been very difficult
to come across it.</p>
<p>Taylor looked up at his wife.
She was thinking too much about
it, the last few months. They all
were.</p>
<p>"Forget it," he said. "It's all
in the past. There isn't anybody
up there now but the leadys, and
they don't mind."</p>
<p>"But just the same, I hope
they're careful when they let one
of them down here. If one were
still hot—"</p>
<p>He laughed, pushing himself
away from the table. "Forget it.
This is a wonderful moment; I'll
be home for the next two shifts.
Nothing to do but sit around and
take things easy. Maybe we can
take in a show. Okay?"</p>
<p>"A show? Do we have to? I
don't like to look at all the destruction,
the ruins. Sometimes I
see some place I remember, like
San Francisco. They showed a
shot of San Francisco, the bridge
broken and fallen in the water,
and I got upset. I don't like to
watch."</p>
<p>"But don't you want to know
what's going on? No human beings
are getting hurt, you know."</p>
<p>"But it's so awful!" Her face
was set and strained. "Please,
no, Don."</p>
<p>Don Taylor picked up his
newspaper sullenly. "All right,
but there isn't a hell of a lot else
to do. And don't forget, <i>their</i>
cities are getting it even worse."</p>
<p>She nodded. Taylor turned the
rough, thin sheets of newspaper.
His good mood had soured on
him. Why did she have to fret
all the time? They were pretty
well off, as things went. You
couldn't expect to have everything
perfect, living undersurface,
with an artificial sun and artificial
food. Naturally it was a
strain, not seeing the sky or being
able to go any place or see anything
other than metal walls,
great roaring factories, the plant-yards,
barracks. But it was better
than being on surface. And some
day it would end and they could
return. Nobody <i>wanted</i> to live
this way, but it was necessary.</p>
<p>He turned the page angrily and
the poor paper ripped. Damn it,
the paper was getting worse quality
all the time, bad print, yellow
tint—</p>
<p>Well, they needed everything
for the war program. He ought to
know that. Wasn't he one of the
planners?</p>
<p>He excused himself and went
into the other room. The bed
was still unmade. They had better
get it in shape before the seventh
hour inspection. There was
a one unit fine—</p>
<p>The vidphone rang. He halted.
Who would it be? He went over
and clicked it on.</p>
<p>"Taylor?" the face said, forming
into place. It was an old face,
gray and grim. "This is Moss.
I'm sorry to bother you during
Rest Period, but this thing has
come up." He rattled papers. "I
want you to hurry over here."</p>
<p>Taylor stiffened. "What is it?
There's no chance it could wait?"
The calm gray eyes were studying
him, expressionless, unjudging.
"If you want me to come
down to the lab," Taylor grumbled,
"I suppose I can. I'll get my
uniform—"</p>
<p>"No. Come as you are. And not
to the lab. Meet me at second
stage as soon as possible. It'll
take you about a half hour, using
the fast car up. I'll see you there."</p>
<p>The picture broke and Moss
disappeared.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"What</span> was it?" Mary said,
at the door.</p>
<p>"Moss. He wants me for something."</p>
<p>"I knew this would happen."</p>
<p>"Well, you didn't want to do
anything, anyhow. What does it
matter?" His voice was bitter.
"It's all the same, every day.
I'll bring you back something.
I'm going up to second stage.
Maybe I'll be close enough to the
surface to—"</p>
<p>"Don't! Don't bring me anything!
Not from the surface!"</p>
<p>"All right, I won't. But of all
the irrational nonsense—"</p>
<p>She watched him put on his
boots without answering.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Moss</span> nodded and Taylor fell
in step with him, as the
older man strode along. A series
of loads were going up to the
surface, blind cars clanking like
ore-trucks up the ramp, disappearing
through the stage trap
above them. Taylor watched the
cars, heavy with tubular machinery
of some sort, weapons new
to him. Workers were everywhere,
in the dark gray uniforms
of the labor corps, loading, lifting,
shouting back and forth. The
stage was deafening with noise.</p>
<p>"We'll go up a way," Moss
said, "where we can talk. This
is no place to give you details."</p>
<p>They took an escalator up. The
commercial lift fell behind them,
and with it most of the crashing
and booming. Soon they emerged
on an observation platform, suspended
on the side of the Tube,
the vast tunnel leading to the
surface, not more than half a
mile above them now.</p>
<p>"My God!" Taylor said, looking
down the Tube involuntarily.
"It's a long way down."</p>
<p>Moss laughed. "Don't look."</p>
<p>They opened a door and entered
an office. Behind the desk,
an officer was sitting, an officer
of Internal Security. He looked
up.</p>
<p>"I'll be right with you, Moss."
He gazed at Taylor studying him.
"You're a little ahead of time."</p>
<p>"This is Commander Franks,"
Moss said to Taylor. "He was
the first to make the discovery.
I was notified last night." He
tapped a parcel he carried. "I
was let in because of this."</p>
<p>Franks frowned at him and
stood up. "We're going up to
first stage. We can discuss it
there."</p>
<p>"First stage?" Taylor repeated
nervously. The three of them
went down a side passage to a
small lift. "I've never been up
there. Is it all right? It's not
radioactive, is it?"</p>
<p>"You're like everyone else,"
Franks said. "Old women afraid
of burglars. No radiation leaks
down to first stage. There's lead
and rock, and what comes down
the Tube is bathed."</p>
<p>"What's the nature of the problem?"
Taylor asked. "I'd like to
know something about it."</p>
<p>"In a moment."</p>
<p>They entered the lift and ascended.
When they stepped out,
they were in a hall of soldiers,
weapons and uniforms everywhere.
Taylor blinked in surprise.
So this was first stage, the
closest undersurface level to the
top! After this stage there was
only rock, lead and rock, and
the great tubes leading up like
the burrows of earthworms. Lead
and rock, and above that, where
the tubes opened, the great expanse
that no living being had
seen for eight years, the vast,
endless ruin that had once been
Man's home, the place where he
had lived, eight years ago.</p>
<p>Now the surface was a lethal
desert of slag and rolling clouds.
Endless clouds drifted back and
forth, blotting out the red Sun.
Occasionally something metallic
stirred, moving through the remains
of a city, threading its way
across the tortured terrain of
the countryside. A leady, a surface
robot, immune to radiation,
constructed with feverish haste
in the last months before the cold
war became literally hot.</p>
<p>Leadys, crawling along the
ground, moving over the oceans
or through the skies in slender,
blackened craft, creatures that
could exist where no <i>life</i> could
remain, metal and plastic figures
that waged a war Man had conceived,
but which he could not
fight himself. Human beings had
invented war, invented and manufactured
the weapons, even invented
the players, the fighters,
the actors of the war. But they
themselves could not venture
forth, could not wage it themselves.
In all the world—in
Russia, in Europe, America,
Africa—no living human being
remained. They were under the
surface, in the deep shelters that
had been carefully planned and
built, even as the first bombs
began to fall.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant idea and the
only idea that could have worked.
Up above, on the ruined, blasted
surface of what had once been a
living planet, the leady crawled
and scurried, and fought Man's
war. And undersurface, in the
depths of the planet, human
beings toiled endlessly to produce
the weapons to continue the
fight, month by month, year by
year.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"First</span> stage," Taylor said. A
strange ache went through
him. "Almost to the surface."</p>
<p>"But not quite," Moss said.</p>
<p>Franks led them through the
soldiers, over to one side, near the
lip of the Tube.</p>
<p>"In a few minutes, a lift will
bring something down to us from
the surface," he explained. "You
see, Taylor, every once in a
while Security examines and interrogates
a surface leady, one
that has been above for a time,
to find out certain things. A vidcall
is sent up and contact is
made with a field headquarters.
We need this direct interview;
we can't depend on vidscreen
contact alone. The leadys are doing
a good job, but we want to
make certain that everything is
going the way we want it."</p>
<p>Franks faced Taylor and Moss
and continued: "The lift will
bring down a leady from the
surface, one of the A-class leadys.
There's an examination chamber
in the next room, with a lead wall
in the center, so the interviewing
officers won't be exposed to radiation.
We find this easier than
bathing the leady. It is going
right back up; it has a job to
get back to.</p>
<p>"Two days ago, an A-class
leady was brought down and interrogated.
I conducted the session
myself. We were interested
in a new weapon the Soviets
have been using, an automatic
mine that pursues anything that
moves. Military had sent instructions
up that the mine be observed
and reported in detail.</p>
<p>"This A-class leady was
brought down with information.
We learned a few facts from it,
obtained the usual roll of film
and reports, and then sent it back
up. It was going out of the chamber,
back to the lift, when a curious
thing happened. At the time,
I thought—"</p>
<p>Franks broke off. A red light
was flashing.</p>
<p>"That down lift is coming." He
nodded to some soldiers. "Let's
enter the chamber. The leady will
be along in a moment."</p>
<p>"An A-class leady," Taylor
said. "I've seen them on the
showscreens, making their reports."</p>
<p>"It's quite an experience,"
Moss said. "They're almost human."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> entered the chamber
and seated themselves behind
the lead wall. After a time, a
signal was flashed, and Franks
made a motion with his hands.</p>
<p>The door beyond the wall
opened. Taylor peered through
his view slot. He saw something
advancing slowly, a slender metallic
figure moving on a tread,
its arm grips at rest by its sides.
The figure halted and scanned
the lead wall. It stood, waiting.</p>
<p>"We are interested in learning
something," Franks said. "Before
I question you, do you have anything
to report on surface conditions?"</p>
<p>"No. The war continues." The
leady's voice was automatic and
toneless. "We are a little short
of fast pursuit craft, the single-seat
type. We could use also
some—"</p>
<p>"That has all been noted. What
I want to ask you is this. Our
contact with you has been
through vidscreen only. We must
rely on indirect evidence, since
none of us goes above. We can
only infer what is going on. We
never see anything ourselves. We
have to take it all secondhand.
Some top leaders are beginning to
think there's too much room for
error."</p>
<p>"Error?" the leady asked. "In
what way? Our reports are
checked carefully before they're
sent down. We maintain constant
contact with you; everything of
value is reported. Any new weapons
which the enemy is seen to
employ—"</p>
<p>"I realize that," Franks grunted
behind his peep slot. "But
perhaps we should see it all for
ourselves. Is it possible that there
might be a large enough radiation-free
area for a human party
to ascend to the surface? If a few
of us were to come up in lead-lined
suits, would we be able to
survive long enough to observe
conditions and watch things?"</p>
<p>The machine hesitated before
answering. "I doubt it. You can
check air samples, of course, and
decide for yourselves. But in the
eight years since you left, things
have continually worsened. You
cannot have any real idea of conditions
up there. It has become
difficult for any moving object
to survive for long. There are
many kinds of projectiles sensitive
to movement. The new mine
not only reacts to motion, but
continues to pursue the object
indefinitely, until it finally
reaches it. And the radiation is
everywhere."</p>
<p>"I see." Franks turned to Moss,
his eyes narrowed oddly. "Well,
that was what I wanted to know.
You may go."</p>
<p>The machine moved back toward
its exit. It paused. "Each
month the amount of lethal particles
in the atmosphere increases.
The tempo of the war is gradually—"</p>
<p>"I understand." Franks rose.
He held out his hand and Moss
passed him the package. "One
thing before you leave. I want
you to examine a new type of
metal shield material. I'll pass
you a sample with the tong."</p>
<p>Franks put the package in the
toothed grip and revolved the
tong so that he held the other
end. The package swung down to
the leady, which took it. They
watched it unwrap the package
and take the metal plate in its
hands. The leady turned the
metal over and over.</p>
<p>Suddenly it became rigid.</p>
<p>"All right," Franks said.</p>
<p>He put his shoulder against the
wall and a section slid aside.
Taylor gasped—Franks and Moss
were hurrying up to the leady!</p>
<p>"Good God!" Taylor said. "But
it's radioactive!"</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> leady stood unmoving,
still holding the metal. Soldiers
appeared in the chamber.
They surrounded the leady and
ran a counter across it carefully.</p>
<p>"Okay, sir," one of them said
to Franks. "It's as cold as a
long winter evening."</p>
<p>"Good. I was sure, but I didn't
want to take any chances."</p>
<p>"You see," Moss said to Taylor,
"this leady isn't hot at all.
Yet it came directly from the
surface, without even being
bathed."</p>
<p>"But what does it mean?"
Taylor asked blankly.</p>
<p>"It may be an accident,"
Franks said. "There's always the
possibility that a given object
might escape being exposed
above. But this is the second
time it's happened that we know
of. There may be others."</p>
<p>"The second time?"</p>
<p>"The previous interview was
when we noticed it. The leady
was not hot. It was cold, too,
like this one."</p>
<p>Moss took back the metal plate
from the leady's hands. He pressed
the surface carefully and returned
it to the stiff, unprotesting
fingers.</p>
<p>"We shorted it out with this,
so we could get close enough for
a thorough check. It'll come back
on in a second now. We had
better get behind the wall again."</p>
<p>They walked back and the lead
wall swung closed behind them.
The soldiers left the chamber.</p>
<p>"Two periods from now,"
Franks said softly, "an initial investigating
party will be ready to
go surface-side. We're going up
the Tube in suits, up to the
top—the first human party to
leave undersurface in eight
years."</p>
<p>"It may mean nothing," Moss
said, "but I doubt it. Something's
going on, something strange. The
leady told us no life could exist
above without being roasted. The
story doesn't fit."</p>
<p>Taylor nodded. He stared
through the peep slot at the immobile
metal figure. Already the
leady was beginning to stir. It
was bent in several places, dented
and twisted, and its finish was
blackened and charred. It was a
leady that had been up there a
long time; it had seen war and
destruction, ruin so vast that no
human being could imagine the
extent. It had crawled and slunk
in a world of radiation and death,
a world where no life could exist.</p>
<p>And Taylor had touched it!</p>
<p>"You're going with us," Franks
said suddenly. "I want you along.
I think the three of us will go."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mary</span> faced him with a sick
and frightened expression.
"I know it. You're going to the
surface. Aren't you?"</p>
<p>She followed him into the kitchen.
Taylor sat down, looking
away from her.</p>
<p>"It's a classified project," he
evaded. "I can't tell you anything
about it."</p>
<p>"You don't have to tell me. I
know. I knew it the moment you
came in. There was something on
your face, something I haven't
seen there for a long, long time.
It was an old look."</p>
<p>She came toward him. "But
how can they send you to the
surface?" She took his face in
her shaking hands, making him
look at her. There was a strange
hunger in her eyes. "Nobody can
live up there. Look, look at
this!"</p>
<p>She grabbed up a newspaper
and held it in front of him.</p>
<p>"Look at this photograph.
America, Europe, Asia, Africa—nothing
but ruins. We've seen it
every day on the showscreens.
All destroyed, poisoned. And
they're sending you up. Why?
No living thing can get by up
there, not even a weed, or grass.
They've wrecked the surface,
haven't they? <i>Haven't they?</i>"</p>
<p>Taylor stood up. "It's an order.
I know nothing about it. I was
told to report to join a scout
party. That's all I know."</p>
<p>He stood for a long time, staring
ahead. Slowly, he reached for
the newspaper and held it up to
the light.</p>
<p>"It looks real," he murmured.
"Ruins, deadness, slag. It's convincing.
All the reports, photographs,
films, even air samples.
Yet we haven't seen it for ourselves,
not after the first
months ..."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Nothing." He put the paper
down. "I'm leaving early after the
next Sleep Period. Let's turn in."</p>
<p>Mary turned away, her face
hard and harsh. "Do what you
want. We might just as well all
go up and get killed at once, instead
of dying slowly down here,
like vermin in the ground."</p>
<p>He had not realized how resentful
she was. Were they all
like that? How about the workers
toiling in the factories, day
and night, endlessly? The pale,
stooped men and women, plodding
back and forth to work,
blinking in the colorless light,
eating synthetics—</p>
<p>"You shouldn't be so bitter,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mary smiled a little. "I'm bitter
because I know you'll never
come back." She turned away.
"I'll never see you again, once
you go up there."</p>
<p>He was shocked. "What? How
can you say a thing like that?"</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> awakened with the public
newscaster screeching in his
ears, shouting outside the building.</p>
<p>"Special news bulletin! Surface
forces report enormous Soviet
attack with new weapons! Retreat
of key groups! All work
units report to factories at once!"</p>
<p>Taylor blinked, rubbing his
eyes. He jumped out of bed and
hurried to the vidphone. A moment
later he was put through
to Moss.</p>
<p>"Listen," he said. "What about
this new attack? Is the project
off?" He could see Moss's desk,
covered with reports and papers.</p>
<p>"No," Moss said. "We're going
right ahead. Get over here at
once."</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>"Don't argue with me." Moss
held up a handful of surface
bulletins, crumpling them savagely.
"This is a fake. Come on!"
He broke off.</p>
<p>Taylor dressed furiously, his
mind in a daze.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, he leaped
from a fast car and hurried up
the stairs into the Synthetics
Building. The corridors were full
of men and women rushing in
every direction. He entered
Moss's office.</p>
<p>"There you are," Moss said,
getting up immediately. "Franks
is waiting for us at the outgoing
station."</p>
<p>They went in a Security Car,
the siren screaming. Workers
scattered out of their way.</p>
<p>"What about the attack?" Taylor
asked.</p>
<p>Moss braced his shoulders.
"We're certain that we've forced
their hand. We've brought the
issue to a head."</p>
<p>They pulled up at the station
link of the Tube and leaped out.
A moment later they were moving
up at high speed toward the
first stage.</p>
<p>They emerged into a bewildering
scene of activity. Soldiers
were fastening on lead suits,
talking excitedly to each other,
shouting back and forth. Guns
were being given out, instructions
passed.</p>
<p>Taylor studied one of the soldiers.
He was armed with the
dreaded Bender pistol, the new
snub-nosed hand weapon that
was just beginning to come from
the assembly line. Some of the
soldiers looked a little frightened.</p>
<p>"I hope we're not making a
mistake," Moss said, noticing his
gaze.</p>
<p>Franks came toward them.
"Here's the program. The three
of us are going up first, alone.
The soldiers will follow in fifteen
minutes."</p>
<p>"What are we going to tell the
leadys?" Taylor worriedly asked.
"We'll have to tell them something."</p>
<p>"We want to observe the new
Soviet attack." Franks smiled
ironically. "Since it seems to be
so serious, we should be there in
person to witness it."</p>
<p>"And then what?" Taylor said.</p>
<p>"That'll be up to them. Let's
go."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> a small car, they went swiftly
up the Tube, carried by
anti-grav beams from below.
Taylor glanced down from time
to time. It was a long way back,
and getting longer each moment.
He sweated nervously inside his
suit, gripping his Bender pistol
with inexpert fingers.</p>
<p>Why had they chosen him?
Chance, pure chance. Moss had
asked him to come along as a
Department member. Then
Franks had picked him out on
the spur of the moment. And now
they were rushing toward the
surface, faster and faster.</p>
<p>A deep fear, instilled in him
for eight years, throbbed in his
mind. Radiation, certain death,
a world blasted and lethal—</p>
<p>Up and up the car went. Taylor
gripped the sides and closed
his eyes. Each moment they were
closer, the first living creatures
to go above the first stage, up
the Tube past the lead and rock,
up to the surface. The phobic
horror shook him in waves. It
was death; they all knew that.
Hadn't they seen it in the films
a thousand times? The cities, the
sleet coming down, the rolling
clouds—</p>
<p>"It won't be much longer,"
Franks said. "We're almost there.
The surface tower is not expecting
us. I gave orders that no signal
was to be sent."</p>
<p>The car shot up, rushing furiously.
Taylor's head spun; he
hung on, his eyes shut. Up and
up....</p>
<p>The car stopped. He opened
his eyes.</p>
<p>They were in a vast room,
fluorescent-lit, a cavern filled with
equipment and machinery, endless
mounds of material piled in
row after row. Among the stacks,
leadys were working silently,
pushing trucks and handcarts.</p>
<p>"Leadys," Moss said. His face
was pale. "Then we're really on
the surface."</p>
<p>The leadys were going back
and forth with equipment moving
the vast stores of guns and spare
parts, ammunition and supplies
that had been brought to the
surface. And this was the receiving
station for only one Tube;
there were many others, scattered
throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Taylor looked nervously
around him. They were really
there, above ground, on the surface.
This was where the war
was.</p>
<p>"Come on," Franks said. "A
B-class guard is coming our
way."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> stepped out of the car.
A leady was approaching
them rapidly. It coasted up in
front of them and stopped, scanning
them with its hand-weapon
raised.</p>
<p>"This is Security," Franks said.
"Have an A-class sent to me at
once."</p>
<p>The leady hesitated. Other B-class
guards were coming, scooting
across the floor, alert and
alarmed. Moss peered around.</p>
<p>"Obey!" Franks said in a loud,
commanding voice. "You've been
ordered!"</p>
<p>The leady moved uncertainly
away from them. At the end of
the building, a door slid back.
Two A-class leadys appeared,
coming slowly toward them.
Each had a green stripe across its
front.</p>
<p>"From the Surface Council,"
Franks whispered tensely. "This
is above ground, all right. Get
set."</p>
<p>The two leadys approached
warily. Without speaking, they
stopped close by the men, looking
them up and down.</p>
<p>"I'm Franks of Security. We
came from undersurface in order
to—"</p>
<p>"This in incredible," one of the leadys
interrupted him coldly. "You
know you can't live up here. The
whole surface is lethal to you.
You can't possibly remain on the
surface."</p>
<p>"These suits will protect us,"
Franks said. "In any case, it's
not your responsibility. What I
want is an immediate Council
meeting so I can acquaint myself
with conditions, with the situation
here. Can that be arranged?"</p>
<p>"You human beings can't survive
up here. And the new Soviet
attack is directed at this area.
It is in considerable danger."</p>
<p>"We know that. Please assemble
the Council." Franks looked
around him at the vast room, lit
by recessed lamps in the ceiling.
An uncertain quality came into
his voice. "Is it night or day
right now?"</p>
<p>"Night," one of the A-class
leadys said, after a pause. "Dawn
is coming in about two hours."</p>
<p>Franks nodded. "We'll remain
at least two hours, then. As a
concession to our sentimentality,
would you please show us some
place where we can observe the
Sun as it comes up? We would
appreciate it."</p>
<p>A stir went through the leadys.</p>
<p>"It is an unpleasant sight," one
of the leadys said. "You've seen
the photographs; you know what
you'll witness. Clouds of drifting
particles blot out the light, slag
heaps are everywhere, the whole
land is destroyed. For you it will
be a staggering sight, much
worse than pictures and film can
convey."</p>
<p>"However it may be, we'll stay
long enough to see it. Will you
give the order to the Council?"</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Come</span> this way." Reluctantly,
the two leadys coasted toward
the wall of the warehouse.
The three men trudged after
them, their heavy shoes ringing
against the concrete. At the wall,
the two leadys paused.</p>
<p>"This is the entrance to the
Council Chamber. There are
windows in the Chamber Room,
but it is still dark outside, of
course. You'll see nothing right
now, but in two hours—"</p>
<p>"Open the door," Franks said.</p>
<p>The door slid back. They went
slowly inside. The room was
small, a neat room with a round
table in the center, chairs ringing
it. The three of them sat down
silently, and the two leadys followed
after them, taking their
places.</p>
<p>"The other Council Members
are on their way. They have already
been notified and are coming
as quickly as they can. Again
I urge you to go back down."
The leady surveyed the three
human beings. "There is no way
you can meet the conditions up
here. Even we survive with some
trouble, ourselves. How can you
expect to do it?"</p>
<p>The leader approached Franks.</p>
<p>"This astonishes and perplexes
us," it said. "Of course we must
do what you tell us, but allow
me to point out that if you remain
here—"</p>
<p>"We know," Franks said impatiently.
"However, we intend to
remain, at least until sunrise."</p>
<p>"If you insist."</p>
<p>There was silence. The leadys
seemed to be conferring with
each other, although the three
men heard no sound.</p>
<p>"For your own good," the leader
said at last, "you must go back
down. We have discussed this,
and it seems to us that you are
doing the wrong thing for your
own good."</p>
<p>"We are human beings," Franks
said sharply. "Don't you understand?
We're men, not machines."</p>
<p>"That is precisely why you
must go back. This room is radioactive;
all surface areas are.
We calculate that your suits will
not protect you for over fifty
more minutes. Therefore—"</p>
<p>The leadys moved abruptly toward
the men, wheeling in a circle,
forming a solid row. The men
stood up, Taylor reaching awkwardly
for his weapon, his fingers
numb and stupid. The men stood
facing the silent metal figures.</p>
<p>"We must insist," the leader
said, its voice without emotion.
"We must take you back to the
Tube and send you down on the
next car. I am sorry, but it is
necessary."</p>
<p>"What'll we do?" Moss said
nervously to Franks. He touched
his gun. "Shall we blast them?"</p>
<p>Franks shook his head. "All
right," he said to the leader.
"We'll go back."</p>
<hr>
<div class="figcenter"><img alt="" height="311" src="images/002.png" title="" width="600" id="img_images_002.png"></div>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> moved toward the door,
motioning Taylor and Moss
to follow him. They looked at
him in surprise, but they came
with him. The leadys followed
them out into the great warehouse.
Slowly they moved toward
the Tube entrance, none of them
speaking.</p>
<p>At the lip, Franks turned. "We
are going back because we have
no choice. There are three of us
and about a dozen of you. However,
if—"</p>
<p>"Here comes the car," Taylor
said.</p>
<p>There was a grating sound
from the Tube. D-class leadys
moved toward the edge to receive
it.</p>
<p>"I am sorry," the leader said,
"but it is for your protection. We
are watching over you, literally.
You must stay below and let us
conduct the war. In a sense, it
has come to be <i>our</i> war. We must
fight it as we see fit."</p>
<p>The car rose to the surface.</p>
<p>Twelve soldiers, armed with
Bender pistols, stepped from it
and surrounded the three men.</p>
<p>Moss breathed a sigh of relief.
"Well, this does change things. It
came off just right."</p>
<p>The leader moved back, away
from the soldiers. It studied them
intently, glancing from one to
the next, apparently trying to
make up its mind. At last it
made a sign to the other leadys.
They coasted aside and a corridor
was opened up toward the
warehouse.</p>
<p>"Even now," the leader said,
"we could send you back by
force. But it is evident that this
is not really an observation party
at all. These soldiers show that
you have much more in mind;
this was all carefully prepared."</p>
<p>"Very carefully," Franks said.</p>
<p>They closed in.</p>
<p>"How much more, we can only
guess. I must admit that we were
taken unprepared. We failed utterly
to meet the situation. Now
force would be absurd, because
neither side can afford to injure
the other; we, because of the restrictions
placed on us regarding
human life, you because the war
demands—"</p>
<p>The soldiers fired, quick and
in fright. Moss dropped to one
knee, firing up. The leader dissolved
in a cloud of particles. On
all sides D- and B-class leadys
were rushing up, some with weapons,
some with metal slats. The
room was in confusion. Off in
the distance a siren was screaming.
Franks and Taylor were cut
off from the others, separated
from the soldiers by a wall of
metal bodies.</p>
<p>"They can't fire back," Franks
said calmly. "This is another
bluff. They've tried to bluff us all
the way." He fired into the face
of a leady. The leady dissolved.
"They can only try to frighten
us. Remember that."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> went on firing and leady
after leady vanished. The
room reeked with the smell of
burning metal, the stink of fused
plastic and steel. Taylor had been
knocked down. He was struggling
to find his gun, reaching wildly
among metal legs, groping frantically
to find it. His fingers
strained, a handle swam in front
of him. Suddenly something came
down on his arm, a metal foot.
He cried out.</p>
<p>Then it was over. The leadys
were moving away, gathering together
off to one side. Only four
of the Surface Council remained.
The others were radioactive particles
in the air. D-class leadys
were already restoring order,
gathering up partly destroyed
metal figures and bits and removing
them.</p>
<p>Franks breathed a shuddering
sigh.</p>
<p>"All right," he said. "You can
take us back to the windows. It
won't be long now."</p>
<p>The leadys separated, and the
human group, Moss and Franks
and Taylor and the soldiers,
walked slowly across the room,
toward the door. They entered
the Council Chamber. Already a
faint touch of gray mitigated the
blackness of the windows.</p>
<p>"Take us outside," Franks said
impatiently. "We'll see it directly,
not in here."</p>
<p>A door slid open. A chill blast
of cold morning air rushed in,
chilling them even through their
lead suits. The men glanced at
each other uneasily.</p>
<p>"Come on," Franks said. "Outside."</p>
<p>He walked out through the
door, the others following him.</p>
<p>They were on a hill, overlooking
the vast bowl of a valley.
Dimly, against the graying sky,
the outline of mountains were
forming, becoming tangible.</p>
<p>"It'll be bright enough to see
in a few minutes," Moss said. He
shuddered as a chilling wind
caught him and moved around
him. "It's worth it, really worth
it, to see this again after eight
years. Even if it's the last thing
we see—"</p>
<p>"Watch," Franks snapped.</p>
<p>They obeyed, silent and subdued.
The sky was clearing,
brightening each moment. Some
place far off, echoing across the
valley, a rooster crowed.</p>
<p>"A chicken!" Taylor murmured.
"Did you hear?"</p>
<p>Behind them, the leadys had
come out and were standing silently,
watching, too. The gray
sky turned to white and the hills
appeared more clearly. Light
spread across the valley floor,
moving toward them.</p>
<p>"God in heaven!" Franks exclaimed.</p>
<p>Trees, trees and forests. A valley
of plants and trees, with a
few roads winding among them.
Farmhouses. A windmill. A barn,
far down below them.</p>
<p>"Look!" Moss whispered.</p>
<p>Color came into the sky. The
Sun was approaching. Birds began
to sing. Not far from where
they stood, the leaves of a tree
danced in the wind.</p>
<p>Franks turned to the row of
leadys behind them.</p>
<p>"Eight years. We were tricked.
There was no war. As soon as we
left the surface—"</p>
<p>"Yes," an A-class leady admitted.
"As soon as you left, the
war ceased. You're right, it was
a hoax. You worked hard undersurface,
sending up guns and
weapons, and we destroyed them
as fast as they came up."</p>
<p>"But why?" Taylor asked,
dazed. He stared down at the
vast valley below. "Why?"</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You</span> created us," the leady
said, "to pursue the war for
you, while you human beings
went below the ground in order
to survive. But before we could
continue the war, it was necessary
to analyze it to determine what
its purpose was. We did this, and
we found that it had no purpose,
except, perhaps, in terms of human
needs. Even this was questionable.</p>
<p>"We investigated further. We
found that human cultures pass
through phases, each culture in
its own time. As the culture ages
and begins to lose its objectives,
conflict arises within it between
those who wish to cast it off and
set up a new culture-pattern,
and those who wish to retain the
old with as little change as possible.</p>
<p>"At this point, a great danger
appears. The conflict within
threatens to engulf the society in
self-war, group against group.
The vital traditions may be lost—not
merely altered or reformed,
but completely destroyed in this
period of chaos and anarchy. We
have found many such examples
in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>"It is necessary for this hatred
within the culture to be directed
outward, toward an external
group, so that the culture itself
may survive its crisis. War is the
result. War, to a logical mind, is
absurd. But in terms of human
needs, it plays a vital role. And
it will continue to until Man has
grown up enough so that no
hatred lies within him."</p>
<p>Taylor was listening intently.
"Do you think this time will
come?"</p>
<p>"Of course. It has almost arrived
now. This is the last war.
Man is <i>almost</i> united into one
final culture—a world culture. At
this point he stands continent
against continent, one half of the
world against the other half. Only
a single step remains, the jump to
a unified culture. Man has climbed
slowly upward, tending always
toward unification of his culture.
It will not be long—</p>
<p>"But it has not come yet, and
so the war had to go on, to satisfy
the last violent surge of hatred
that Man felt. Eight years have
passed since the war began. In
these eight years, we have observed
and noted important
changes going on in the minds
of men. Fatigue and disinterest,
we have seen, are gradually taking
the place of hatred and fear.
The hatred is being exhausted
gradually, over a period of time.
But for the present, the hoax
must go on, at least for a while
longer. You are not ready to
learn the truth. You would want
to continue the war."</p>
<p>"But how did you manage it?"
Moss asked. "All the photographs,
the samples, the damaged
equipment—"</p>
<p>"Come over here." The leady
directed them toward a long, low
building. "Work goes on constantly,
whole staffs laboring to
maintain a coherent and convincing
picture of a global war."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> entered the building.
Leadys were working everywhere,
poring over tables and
desks.</p>
<p>"Examine this project here,"
the A-class leady said. Two leadys
were carefully photographing
something, an elaborate model
on a table top. "It is a good example."</p>
<p>The men grouped around, trying
to see. It was a model of a
ruined city.</p>
<p>Taylor studied it in silence for
a long time. At last he looked up.</p>
<p>"It's San Francisco," he said in
a low voice. "This is a model of
San Francisco, destroyed. I saw
this on the vidscreen, piped down
to us. The bridges were hit—"</p>
<p>"Yes, notice the bridges." The
leady traced the ruined span with
his metal finger, a tiny spider-web,
almost invisible. "You have
no doubt seen photographs of
this many times, and of the other
tables in this building.</p>
<p>"San Francisco itself is completely
intact. We restored it
soon after you left, rebuilding the
parts that had been damaged at
the start of the war. The work of
manufacturing news goes on all
the time in this particular building.
We are very careful to see
that each part fits in with all the
other parts. Much time and effort
are devoted to it."</p>
<p>Franks touched one of the tiny
model buildings, lying half in
ruins. "So this is what you spend
your time doing—making model
cities and then blasting them."</p>
<p>"No, we do much more. We
are caretakers, watching over the
whole world. The owners have
left for a time, and we must see
that the cities are kept clean, that
decay is prevented, that everything
is kept oiled and in running
condition. The gardens, the
streets, the water mains, everything
must be maintained as it
was eight years ago, so that when
the owners return, they will not
be displeased. We want to be
sure that they will be completely
satisfied."</p>
<p>Franks tapped Moss on the
arm.</p>
<p>"Come over here," he said in a
low voice. "I want to talk to
you."</p>
<p>He led Moss and Taylor out of
the building, away from the leadys,
outside on the hillside. The
soldiers followed them. The Sun
was up and the sky was turning
blue. The air smelled sweet and
good, the smell of growing things.</p>
<p>Taylor removed his helmet and
took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I haven't smelled that smell
for a long time," he said.</p>
<p>"Listen," Franks said, his voice
low and hard. "We must get back
down at once. There's a lot to get
started on. All this can be turned
to our advantage."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Moss
asked.</p>
<p>"It's a certainty that the Soviets
have been tricked, too, the
same as us. But <i>we</i> have found
out. That gives us an edge over
them."</p>
<p>"I see." Moss nodded. "We
know, but they don't. Their Surface
Council has sold out, the
same as ours. It works against
them the same way. But if we
could—"</p>
<p>"With a hundred top-level
men, we could take over again,
restore things as they should be!
It would be easy!"</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Moss</span> touched him on the arm.
An A-class leady was coming
from the building toward
them.</p>
<p>"We've seen enough," Franks
said, raising his voice. "All this
is very serious. It must be reported
below and a study made to determine
our policy."</p>
<p>The leady said nothing.</p>
<p>Franks waved to the soldiers.
"Let's go." He started toward the
warehouse.</p>
<p>Most of the soldiers had removed
their helmets. Some of
them had taken their lead suits
off, too, and were relaxing comfortably
in their cotton uniforms.
They stared around them, down
the hillside at the trees and bushes,
the vast expanse of green, the
mountains and the sky.</p>
<p>"Look at the Sun," one of them
murmured.</p>
<p>"It sure is bright as hell," another
said.</p>
<p>"We're going back down,"
Franks said. "Fall in by twos and
follow us."</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the soldiers regrouped.
The leadys watched
without emotion as the men
marched slowly back toward the
warehouse. Franks and Moss and
Taylor led them across the
ground, glancing alertly at the
leadys as they walked.</p>
<p>They entered the warehouse.
D-class leadys were loading material
and weapons on surface
carts. Cranes and derricks were
working busily everywhere. The
work was done with efficiency,
but without hurry or excitement.</p>
<p>The men stopped, watching.
Leadys operating the little carts
moved past them, signaling silently
to each other. Guns and
parts were being hoisted by magnetic
cranes and lowered gently
onto waiting carts.</p>
<p>"Come on," Franks said.</p>
<p>He turned toward the lip of the
Tube. A row of D-class leadys
was standing in front of it, immobile
and silent. Franks stopped,
moving back. He looked
around. An A-class leady was
coming toward him.</p>
<p>"Tell them to get out of the
way," Franks said. He touched
his gun. "You had better move
them."</p>
<p>Time passed, an endless moment,
without measure. The men
stood, nervous and alert, watching
the row of leadys in front of
them.</p>
<p>"As you wish," the A-class
leady said.</p>
<p>It signaled and the D-class
leadys moved into life. They
stepped slowly aside.</p>
<p>Moss breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"I'm glad that's over," he said
to Franks. "Look at them all.
Why don't they try to stop us?
They must know what we're going
to do."</p>
<p>Franks laughed. "Stop us?
You saw what happened when
they tried to stop us before. They
can't; they're only machines. We
built them so they can't lay hands
on us, and they know that."</p>
<p>His voice trailed off.</p>
<p>The men stared at the Tube
entrance. Around them the leadys
watched, silent and impassive,
their metal faces expressionless.</p>
<p>For a long time the men stood
without moving. At last Taylor
turned away.</p>
<p>"Good God," he said. He was
numb, without feeling of any
kind.</p>
<p>The Tube was gone. It was
sealed shut, fused over. Only a
dull surface of cooling metal
greeted them.</p>
<p>The Tube had been closed.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Franks</span> turned, his face pale
and vacant.</p>
<p>The A-class leady shifted. "As
you can see, the Tube has been
shut. We were prepared for this.
As soon as all of you were on the
surface, the order was given. If
you had gone back when we
asked you, you would now be
safely down below. We had to
work quickly because it was such
an immense operation."</p>
<p>"But why?" Moss demanded
angrily.</p>
<p>"Because it is unthinkable that
you should be allowed to resume
the war. With all the Tubes sealed,
it will be many months before
forces from below can reach the
surface, let alone organize a military
program. By that time the
cycle will have entered its last
stages. You will not be so perturbed
to find your world intact.</p>
<p>"We had hoped that you would
be undersurface when the sealing
occurred. Your presence here is a
nuisance. When the Soviets broke
through, we were able to accomplish
their sealing without—"</p>
<p>"The Soviets? They broke
through?"</p>
<p>"Several months ago, they
came up unexpectedly to see why
the war had not been won. We
were forced to act with speed. At
this moment they are desperately
attempting to cut new Tubes to
the surface, to resume the war.
We have, however, been able to
seal each new one as it appears."</p>
<p>The leady regarded the three
men calmly.</p>
<p>"We're cut off," Moss said,
trembling. "We can't get back.
What'll we do?"</p>
<p>"How did you manage to seal
the Tube so quickly?" Franks
asked the leady. "We've been up
here only two hours."</p>
<p>"Bombs are placed just above
the first stage of each Tube for
such emergencies. They are heat
bombs. They fuse lead and rock."</p>
<p>Gripping the handle of his gun,
Franks turned to Moss and Taylor.</p>
<p>"What do you say? We can't
go back, but we can do a lot of
damage, the fifteen of us. We
have Bender guns. How about
it?"</p>
<p>He looked around. The soldiers
had wandered away again, back
toward the exit of the building.
They were standing outside, looking
at the valley and the sky. A
few of them were carefully climbing
down the slope.</p>
<p>"Would you care to turn over
your suits and guns?" the A-class
leady asked politely. "The suits
are uncomfortable and you'll
have no need for weapons. The
Russians have given up theirs, as
you can see."</p>
<p>Fingers tensed on triggers.
Four men in Russian uniforms
were coming toward them from
an aircraft that they suddenly
realized had landed silently some
distance away.</p>
<p>"Let them have it!" Franks
shouted.</p>
<p>"They are unarmed," said the
leady. "We brought them here so
you could begin peace talks."</p>
<p>"We have no authority to
speak for our country," Moss
said stiffly.</p>
<p>"We do not mean diplomatic
discussions," the leady explained.
"There will be no more. The
working out of daily problems of
existence will teach you how to
get along in the same world. It
will not be easy, but it will be
done."</p>
<hr>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Russians halted and they
faced each other with raw
hostility.</p>
<p>"I am Colonel Borodoy and I
regret giving up our guns," the
senior Russian said. "You could
have been the first Americans to
be killed in almost eight years."</p>
<p>"Or the first Americans to kill,"
Franks corrected.</p>
<p>"No one would know of it except
yourselves," the leady pointed
out. "It would be useless
heroism. Your real concern
should be surviving on the surface.
We have no food for you,
you know."</p>
<p>Taylor put his gun in its holster.
"They've done a neat job
of neutralizing us, damn them. I
propose we move into a city,
start raising crops with the help
of some leadys, and generally
make ourselves comfortable."
Drawing his lips tight over his
teeth, he glared at the A-class
leady. "Until our families can
come up from undersurface, it's
going to be pretty lonesome, but
we'll have to manage."</p>
<p>"If I may make a suggestion,"
said another Russian uneasily.
"We tried living in a city. It is
too empty. It is also too hard to
maintain for so few people. We
finally settled in the most modern
village we could find."</p>
<p>"Here in this country," a third
Russian blurted. "We have much
to learn from you."</p>
<p>The Americans abruptly found
themselves laughing.</p>
<p>"You probably have a thing or
two to teach us yourselves," said
Taylor generously, "though I
can't imagine what."</p>
<p>The Russian colonel grinned.
"Would you join us in our village?
It would make our work
easier and give us company."</p>
<p>"Your village?" snapped
Franks. "It's American, isn't it?
It's ours!"</p>
<p>The leady stepped between
them. "When our plans are completed,
the term will be interchangeable.
'Ours' will eventually
mean mankind's." It pointed at
the aircraft, which was warming
up. "The ship is waiting. Will
you join each other in making a
new home?"</p>
<p>The Russians waited while the
Americans made up their minds.</p>
<p>"I see what the leadys mean
about diplomacy becoming outmoded,"
Franks said at last.
"People who work together don't
need diplomats. They solve their
problems on the operational level
instead of at a conference table."</p>
<p>The leady led them toward the
ship. "It is the goal of history,
unifying the world. From family
to tribe to city-state to nation to
hemisphere, the direction has
been toward unification. Now the
hemispheres will be joined and—"</p>
<p>Taylor stopped listening and
glanced back at the location of
the Tube. Mary was undersurface
there. He hated to leave her,
even though he couldn't see her
again until the Tube was unsealed.
But then he shrugged and followed
the others.</p>
<p>If this tiny amalgam of former
enemies was a good example, it
wouldn't be too long before he
and Mary and the rest of humanity
would be living on the surface
like rational human beings
instead of blindly hating moles.</p>
<p>"It has taken thousands of
generations to achieve," the A-class
leady concluded. "Hundreds
of centuries of bloodshed and destruction.
But each war was a
step toward uniting mankind.
And now the end is in sight: a
world without war. But even
that is only the beginning of a
new stage of history."</p>
<p>"The conquest of space,"
breathed Colonel Borodoy.</p>
<p>"The meaning of life," Moss
added.</p>
<p>"Eliminating hunger and poverty,"
said Taylor.</p>
<p>The leady opened the door of
the ship. "All that and more.
How much more? We cannot
foresee it any more than the first
men who formed a tribe could
foresee this day. But it will be
unimaginably great."</p>
<p>The door closed and the ship
took off toward their new home.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
