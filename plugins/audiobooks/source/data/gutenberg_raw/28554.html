<h1> <span class="xhtml_big">BEYOND LIES THE WUB</span></h1>
<h2> <span class="xhtml_big">By PHILIP K. DICK</span></h2>
<p class="hd1"><i><span class="xhtml_big">The slovenly wub might well have said: Many men<br>
talk like philosophers and live like fools.</span></i></p>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> had almost finished with the
loading. Outside stood the Optus, his
arms folded, his face sunk in gloom.
Captain Franco walked leisurely down the
gangplank, grinning.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he said. "You're
getting paid for all this."</p>
<p>The Optus said nothing. He turned away,
collecting his robes. The Captain put his
boot on the hem of the robe.</p>
<p>"Just a minute. Don't go off. I'm not
finished."</p>
<p>"Oh?" The Optus turned with dignity. "I
am going back to the village." He looked
toward the animals and birds being driven
up the gangplank into the spaceship. "I
must organize new hunts."</p>
<p>Franco lit a cigarette. "Why not? You
people can go out into the veldt and track
it all down again. But when we run out
halfway between Mars and Earth—"</p>
<p>The Optus went off, wordless. Franco
joined the first mate at the bottom of the
gangplank.</p>
<p>"How's it coming?" he said. He looked
at his watch. "We got a good bargain
here."</p>
<p>The mate glanced at him sourly. "How
do you explain that?"</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you? We need
it more than they do."</p>
<p>"I'll see you later, Captain." The mate
threaded his way up the plank, between the
long-legged Martian go-birds, into the ship.
Franco watched him disappear. He was just
starting up after him, up the plank toward
the port, when he saw <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>"My God!" He stood staring, his hands
on his hips. Peterson was walking along
the path, his face red, leading <i>it</i> by a string.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Captain," he said, tugging at
the string. Franco walked toward him.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>The wub stood sagging, its great body
settling slowly. It was sitting down, its eyes
half shut. A few flies buzzed about its flank,
and it switched its tail.</p>
<p><i>It</i> sat. There was silence.</p>
<p>"It's a wub," Peterson said. "I got it from
a native for fifty cents. He said it was a
very unusual animal. Very respected."</p>
<p>"This?" Franco poked the great sloping
side of the wub. "It's a pig! A huge dirty
pig!"</p>
<p>"Yes sir, it's a pig. The natives call it a
wub."</p>
<p>"A huge pig. It must weigh four hundred
pounds." Franco grabbed a tuft of the
rough hair. The wub gasped. Its eyes
opened, small and moist. Then its great
mouth twitched.</p>
<p>A tear rolled down the wub's cheek and
splashed on the floor.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's good to eat," Peterson said
nervously.</p>
<p>"We'll soon find out," Franco said.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> wub survived the take-off, sound
asleep in the hold of the ship. When
they were out in space and everything was
running smoothly, Captain Franco bade his
men fetch the wub upstairs so that he might
perceive what manner of beast it was.</p>
<p>The wub grunted and wheezed, squeezing
up the passageway.</p>
<p>"Come on," Jones grated, pulling at the
rope. The wub twisted, rubbing its skin off
on the smooth chrome walls. It burst into
the ante-room, tumbling down in a heap.
The men leaped up.</p>
<p>"Good Lord," French said. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Peterson says it's a wub," Jones said.
"It belongs to him." He kicked at the wub.
The wub stood up unsteadily, panting.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with it?" French came
over. "Is it going to be sick?"</p>
<p>They watched. The wub rolled its eyes
mournfully. It gazed around at the men.</p>
<p>"I think it's thirsty," Peterson said. He
went to get some water. French shook his
head.</p>
<p>"No wonder we had so much trouble taking
off. I had to reset all my ballast calculations."</p>
<p>Peterson came back with the water. The
wub began to lap gratefully, splashing the
men.</p>
<p>Captain Franco appeared at the door.</p>
<p>"Let's have a look at it." He advanced,
squinting critically. "You got this for fifty
cents?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," Peterson said. "It eats almost
anything. I fed it on grain and it liked that.
And then potatoes, and mash, and scraps
from the table, and milk. It seems to enjoy
eating. After it eats it lies down and goes
to sleep."</p>
<p>"I see," Captain Franco said. "Now, as
to its taste. That's the real question. I doubt
if there's much point in fattening it up any
more. It seems fat enough to me already.
Where's the cook? I want him here. I want
to find out—"</p>
<p>The wub stopped lapping and looked up
at the Captain.</p>
<p>"Really, Captain," the wub said. "I suggest
we talk of other matters."</p>
<p>The room was silent.</p>
<p>"What was that?" Franco said. "Just
now."</p>
<p>"The wub, sir," Peterson said. "It spoke."</p>
<p>They all looked at the wub.</p>
<p>"What did it say? What did it say?"</p>
<p>"It suggested we talk about other things."</p>
<p>Franco walked toward the wub. He went
all around it, examining it from every side.
Then he came back over and stood with the
men.</p>
<p>"I wonder if there's a native inside it,"
he said thoughtfully. "Maybe we should
open it up and have a look."</p>
<p>"Oh, goodness!" the wub cried. "Is that
all you people can think of, killing and cutting?"</p>
<p>Franco clenched his fists. "Come out of
there! Whoever you are, come out!"</p>
<p>Nothing stirred. The men stood together,
their faces blank, staring at the wub. The
wub swished its tail. It belched suddenly.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," the wub said.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's anyone in there,"
Jones said in a low voice. They all looked
at each other.</p>
<p>The cook came in.</p>
<p>"You wanted me, Captain?" he said.
"What's this thing?"</p>
<p>"This is a wub," Franco said. "It's to be
eaten. Will you measure it and figure out—"</p>
<p>"I think we should have a talk," the wub
said. "I'd like to discuss this with you,
Captain, if I might. I can see that you and
I do not agree on some basic issues."</p>
<p>The Captain took a long time to answer.
The wub waited good-naturedly, licking the
water from its jowls.</p>
<p>"Come into my office," the Captain said
at last. He turned and walked out of the
room. The wub rose and padded after him.
The men watched it go out. They heard it
climbing the stairs.</p>
<p>"I wonder what the outcome will be," the
cook said. "Well, I'll be in the kitchen. Let
me know as soon as you hear."</p>
<p>"Sure," Jones said. "Sure."</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> wub eased itself down in the corner
with a sigh. "You must forgive me," it
said. "I'm afraid I'm addicted to various
forms of relaxation. When one is as large
as I—"</p>
<p>The Captain nodded impatiently. He sat
down at his desk and folded his hands.</p>
<p>"All right," he said. "Let's get started.
You're a wub? Is that correct?"</p>
<p>The wub shrugged. "I suppose so. That's
what they call us, the natives, I mean. We
have our own term."</p>
<p>"And you speak English? You've been in
contact with Earthmen before?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then how do you do it?"</p>
<p>"Speak English? Am I speaking English?
I'm not conscious of speaking anything in
particular. I examined your mind—"</p>
<p>"My mind?"</p>
<p>"I studied the contents, especially the
semantic warehouse, as I refer to it—"</p>
<p>"I see," the Captain said. "Telepathy. Of
course."</p>
<p>"We are a very old race," the wub said.
"Very old and very ponderous. It is difficult
for us to move around. You can appreciate
that anything so slow and heavy would be
at the mercy of more agile forms of life.
There was no use in our relying on physical
defenses. How could we win? Too heavy to
run, too soft to fight, too good-natured to
hunt for game—"</p>
<p>"How do you live?"</p>
<p>"Plants. Vegetables. We can eat almost
anything. We're very catholic. Tolerant,
eclectic, catholic. We live and let live. That's
how we've gotten along."</p>
<p>The wub eyed the Captain.</p>
<p>"And that's why I so violently objected
to this business about having me boiled. I
could see the image in your mind—most
of me in the frozen food locker, some of
me in the kettle, a bit for your pet cat—"</p>
<p>"So you read minds?" the Captain said.
"How interesting. Anything else? I mean,
what else can you do along those lines?"</p>
<p>"A few odds and ends," the wub said
absently, staring around the room. "A nice
apartment you have here, Captain. You
keep it quite neat. I respect life-forms that
are tidy. Some Martian birds are quite tidy.
They throw things out of their nests and
sweep them—"</p>
<p>"Indeed." The Captain nodded. "But to
get back to the problem—"</p>
<p>"Quite so. You spoke of dining on me.
The taste, I am told, is good. A little fatty,
but tender. But how can any lasting contact
be established between your people and
mine if you resort to such barbaric attitudes?
Eat me? Rather you should discuss questions
with me, philosophy, the arts—"</p>
<p>The Captain stood up. "Philosophy. It
might interest you to know that we will be
hard put to find something to eat for the
next month. An unfortunate spoilage—"</p>
<p>"I know." The wub nodded. "But
wouldn't it be more in accord with your
principles of democracy if we all drew
straws, or something along that line? After
all, democracy is to protect the minority
from just such infringements. Now, if each
of us casts one vote—"</p>
<p>The Captain walked to the door.</p>
<p>"Nuts to you," he said. He opened the
door. He opened his mouth.</p>
<p>He stood frozen, his mouth wide, his eyes
staring, his fingers still on the knob.</p>
<p>The wub watched him. Presently it
padded out of the room, edging past the
Captain. It went down the hall, deep in
meditation.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> room was quiet.</p>
<p>"So you see," the wub said, "we have
a common myth. Your mind contains many
familiar myth symbols. Ishtar, Odysseus—"</p>
<p>Peterson sat silently, staring at the floor.
He shifted in his chair.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said. "Please go on."</p>
<p>"I find in your Odysseus a figure common
to the mythology of most self-conscious
races. As I interpret it, Odysseus wanders
as an individual, aware of himself as
such. This is the idea of separation, of
separation from family and country. The
process of individuation."</p>
<p>"But Odysseus returns to his home."
Peterson looked out the port window, at the
stars, endless stars, burning intently in the
empty universe. "Finally he goes home."</p>
<p>"As must all creatures. The moment of
separation is a temporary period, a brief
journey of the soul. It begins, it ends. The
wanderer returns to land and race...."</p>
<p>The door opened. The wub stopped, turning
its great head.</p>
<p>Captain Franco came into the room, the
men behind him. They hesitated at the door.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" French said.</p>
<p>"Do you mean me?" Peterson said, surprised.
"Why me?"</p>
<p>Franco lowered his gun. "Come over
here," he said to Peterson. "Get up and
come here."</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>"Go ahead," the wub said. "It doesn't
matter."</p>
<p>Peterson stood up. "What for?"</p>
<p>"It's an order."</p>
<p>Peterson walked to the door. French
caught his arm.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Peterson wrenched
loose. "What's the matter with you?"</p>
<p>Captain Franco moved toward the wub.
The wub looked up from where it lay in the
corner, pressed against the wall.</p>
<p>"It is interesting," the wub said, "that
you are obsessed with the idea of eating me.
I wonder why."</p>
<p>"Get up," Franco said.</p>
<p>"If you wish." The wub rose, grunting.
"Be patient. It is difficult for me." It stood,
gasping, its tongue lolling foolishly.</p>
<p>"Shoot it now," French said.</p>
<p>"For God's sake!" Peterson exclaimed.
Jones turned to him quickly, his eyes gray
with fear.</p>
<p>"You didn't see him—like a statue,
standing there, his mouth open. If we hadn't
come down, he'd still be there."</p>
<p>"Who? The Captain?" Peterson stared
around. "But he's all right now."</p>
<p>They looked at the wub, standing in the
middle of the room, its great chest rising
and falling.</p>
<p>"Come on," Franco said. "Out of the
way."</p>
<p>The men pulled aside toward the door.</p>
<p>"You are quite afraid, aren't you?" the
wub said. "Have I done anything to you?
I am against the idea of hurting. All I have
done is try to protect myself. Can you expect
me to rush eagerly to my death? I am a
sensible being like yourselves. I was curious
to see your ship, learn about you. I suggested
to the native—"</p>
<p>The gun jerked.</p>
<p>"See," Franco said. "I thought so."</p>
<p>The wub settled down, panting. It put its
paw out, pulling its tail around it.</p>
<p>"It is very warm," the wub said. "I understand
that we are close to the jets.
Atomic power. You have done many wonderful
things with it—technically. Apparently,
your scientific hierarchy is not
equipped to solve moral, ethical—"</p>
<p>Franco turned to the men, crowding behind
him, wide-eyed, silent.</p>
<p>"I'll do it. You can watch."</p>
<p>French nodded. "Try to hit the brain. It's
no good for eating. Don't hit the chest. If
the rib cage shatters, we'll have to pick
bones out."</p>
<p>"Listen," Peterson said, licking his lips.
"Has it done anything? What harm has it
done? I'm asking you. And anyhow, it's
still mine. You have no right to shoot it. It
doesn't belong to you."</p>
<p>Franco raised his gun.</p>
<p>"I'm going out," Jones said, his face
white and sick. "I don't want to see it."</p>
<p>"Me, too," French said. The men
straggled out, murmuring. Peterson lingered
at the door.</p>
<p>"It was talking to me about myths," he
said. "It wouldn't hurt anyone."</p>
<p>He went outside.</p>
<p>Franco walked toward the wub. The wub
looked up slowly. It swallowed.</p>
<p>"A very foolish thing," it said. "I am
sorry that you want to do it. There was a
parable that your Saviour related—"</p>
<p>It stopped, staring at the gun.</p>
<p>"Can you look me in the eye and do it?"
the wub said. "Can you do that?"</p>
<p>The Captain gazed down. "I can look
you in the eye," he said. "Back on the farm
we had hogs, dirty razor-back hogs. I can
do it."</p>
<p>Staring down at the wub, into the gleaming,
moist eyes, he pressed the trigger.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> taste was excellent.</p>
<p>They sat glumly around the table,
some of them hardly eating at all. The only
one who seemed to be enjoying himself was
Captain Franco.</p>
<p>"More?" he said, looking around. "More?
And some wine, perhaps."</p>
<p>"Not me," French said. "I think I'll go
back to the chart room."</p>
<p>"Me, too." Jones stood up, pushing his
chair back. "I'll see you later."</p>
<p>The Captain watched them go. Some of
the others excused themselves.</p>
<p>"What do you suppose the matter is?"
the Captain said. He turned to Peterson.
Peterson sat staring down at his plate, at
the potatoes, the green peas, and at the
thick slab of tender, warm meat.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth. No sound came.</p>
<p>The Captain put his hand on Peterson's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"It is only organic matter, now," he said.
"The life essence is gone." He ate, spooning
up the gravy with some bread. "I, myself,
love to eat. It is one of the greatest things
that a living creature can enjoy. Eating,
resting, meditation, discussing things."</p>
<p>Peterson nodded. Two more men got up
and went out. The Captain drank some
water and sighed.</p>
<p>"Well," he said. "I must say that this
was a very enjoyable meal. All the reports
I had heard were quite true—the taste of
wub. Very fine. But I was prevented from
enjoying this pleasure in times past."</p>
<p>He dabbed at his lips with his napkin and
leaned back in his chair. Peterson stared dejectedly
at the table.</p>
<p>The Captain watched him intently. He
leaned over.</p>
<p>"Come, come," he said. "Cheer up! Let's
discuss things."</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>"As I was saying before I was interrupted,
the role of Odysseus in the
myths—"</p>
<p>Peterson jerked up, staring.</p>
<p>"To go on," the Captain said. "Odysseus,
as I understand him—"</p>

be renamed.
</div><div>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
